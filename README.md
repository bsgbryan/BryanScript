# BryanScript
Welcome! BryanScript is an experiment; I've been a hobbyist game developer for a while and BryanScript is my path the learn a bunch of stuff I've wanted to learn for a long time ðŸ˜ƒ

I've wanted to learn about language, os, and game engine development. BryanScript is my first step on that journey.

The idea is simple: take things I like/love from other languages (the dynamism/flexibility of JavaScript, the whitespace sensitivity of CoffeeScript/Python, etc) and see if they can be merged into one thing.

I also want to build a comprehensive toolchain; a test runner, simple ways to instrument code, and lots ... and I mean *lots* ... of debugging support.

# Starting point

Right now this repo is where I'm at working through the excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com). This is the bytecode vm for that book's language, Lox.

Once I finish the book I'd like to update this vm in the following ways:

1. Add tests for everything (I imagine this will encompass a significant amount of refactoring)
2. Add support for `switch` statements (using hash table, unless I find a better option in the mean time)
3. Add dependency support (I'm super excited about this as I want to model it after the dependency specs from my little Node.js module, [MÃ¤dÅ«l](https://github.com/bsgbryan/madul).
4. Add `async`/`await` support

# Next steps

In addition to the bytecode vm, I'd like to implement native support for:

1. WebAssembly
2. ARM64 assembly
3. x86_64 assembly

# Onward

That's a lot of goals!

Better get back to work ðŸ˜Ž
